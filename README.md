# Doctor_A

This is an Amazon Alexa skill that is able to make a prediction on the type of possible disease that a person might have 
based on their symptoms using the Infermedica API. The skill first asks for the persons age, gender, and known symptoms. It 
then parses the responses and intelligently asks follow up questions until the skill has enough evidence to make a 
reasonable prediction.

How to use the skill:
  1.To start Doctor A, please state "Start Disease Diagnosis". When asked what symptoms you have, please respond by saying 
  2."I have symptom", "I feel symptom" or "I am symptom". 
  3.When answering the multiple choice questions, please respond by saying "My answer is (number)". 
  
As always, you should check up with your doctor about symptoms for a more accurate and realistic diagnosis.
